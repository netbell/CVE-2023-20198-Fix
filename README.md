```

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Ansible installed on your control machine. This playbook was written for Ansible 2.9 or newer.

### Setup
Configure Ansible:
Edit ansible.cfg to match your environment settings.

### Inventory:
Update inventory.yml with the host details of your IOS-XE devices. 

### Variables:
Define any necessary variables in group_vars/iosxe_devices.yml. This should include any common settings for your IOS-XE devices, such as connection settings and credentials.

## Adding Hosts to Inventory
To add a new IOS-XE device to the inventory, edit the inventory.yml file and append the new host under the appropriate group:

```yaml
iosxe_devices:
  hosts:
    vulnerable_router01:
      ansible_host: 192.168.1.3
      # ... other necessary variables
```

Replace new_router01 with your device's hostname and the ansible_* variables with the actual values for your new device.

## Updating Group Variables
If you need to update credentials or other settings for the group of IOS-XE devices, edit the group_vars/iosxe_devices.yml file:

```yaml
---
ansible_network_os: ios
ansible_connection: network_cli
ansible_user: admin
ansible_password: admin_password            # Lab use only, store credentials responsibly!
ansible_become_method: enable
ansible_become_password: admin_password     # Lab use only, store credentials responsibly!
# ... other variables
```


## Running the Playbook
To execute the playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook remediate.yml -i inventory.yml
```

If you are using Ansible Vault for encrypted variables, add the --ask-vault-pass flag to the command, which will prompt you for the vault password.

## Testing
Always test your changes in a controlled environment before running the playbook in production.

## Security
Store sensitive data such as passwords and secret keys using Ansible Vault. Do not store plaintext credentials in your inventory or group_vars files.

For additional security measures and best practices, consult [Ansible's official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html).

Please replace all placeholder values with actual data that corresponds to your environment. This README assumes a basic familiarity with Ansible concepts such as inventory, variables, and running playbooks.
